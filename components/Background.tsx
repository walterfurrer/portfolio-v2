          With over a decades of experience in B2B account management and
          customer support, I bring a rare, user-centric perspective to software
          development. I don't just build applications; I build solutions
          informed by a deep understanding of what end-users truly need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I apply that same problem-solving mindset to building intuitive
          and reliable web applications using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and
          more. My goal is to bridge the gap between user needs and technical
          execution, creating products people love to use while helping them get
          the most out of it.
